ðŸš€ My Mini Project: To-Do List App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Hello! connections, Hope you all doing Good
I'm excited to share my mini project: A To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This app allows users to add tasks and stores them in local storage, so your tasks remain even after closing the browser. Itâ€™s a perfect example of integrating front-end technologies with practical functionality.
